Description: In this project, 
I performed a customer segmentation analysis for a retail client to identify different customer segments based on their purchasing behavior. 
I analyzed sales data using Python and Pandas and used machine learning techniques to cluster customers into different segments.
I then created visualizations using Tableau to present the findings to the client.
My analysis helped the client to better understand their customers and develop targeted marketing strategies.
